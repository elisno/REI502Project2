\section{Pre-processing}

\begin{itemize}

\item The data set can be found in an arff format at \\ \href{github.com/ongxuanhong/Preprocessing-with-horse-colic-dataset/blob/master/horse-colic.arff}{https://github.com/ongxuanhong/Preprocessing-with-horse-colic-dataset/blob/master/horse-colic.arff}

\item If association rule mining is used for classification, the \verb|outcome| attribute is set as the class attribute.\\
The class values are renamed as:
\begin{itemize}
\item lived
\item died
\item was euthanized
\end{itemize}

\item The rectal temperature was discretized to throw out extreme values, using 8 bins.

\item The pulse attribute was also discretized, this time into 8 bins with equal frequency.

\item The respiratory rate was relabeled accordingly:
\begin{itemize}
\item Normal: 8-10 bpm
\item Above Normal: 11-25 bpm
\item Fast: 26-35 bpm
\item Extreme: Over 35 bpm
\end{itemize}

\item Total protein was discretized into 5 bins
\begin{itemize}
\item < 5.5 gms/dL
\item 5.5-6.4 gms/dL
\item 6.5-7.5 gms/dL
\item 7.6 - 10 gms/dL
\item > 10 gms/dL
\end{itemize}


\item Abdomcentesis total protein was split into 3 bins
\begin{itemize}
\item 0- 1.5 gms/dL
\item 1.6 - 3 gms/dL
\item > 3 gms/dL
\end{itemize}

\item packed cell volume was split into 3 bins
\begin{itemize}
\item < 31 \%
\item 31-50 \%
\item > 50 \%
\end{itemize}

\item nasogastric reflux pH was split into 3 bins

\item Removed the Age attribute since it was so skewed


\end{itemize}


The following attributes were removed from the dataset:
\begin{itemize}
\item Type of lesion:
\item Subtype of lesion:
\item Pathology$\_ $cp$ \_$data:
\end{itemize}
Note: Using the \verb|MergeManyValues| for numerical attribues...
